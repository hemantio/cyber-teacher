## 🎯 What is CyberGuard?

CyberGuard is a **next-generation cybersecurity education platform** that transforms complex network security concepts into visual, interactive experiences. Instead of reading textbooks, you **simulate real attacks and defenses** in a safe, sandboxed environment.

> 🎓 Perfect for students, educators, and security professionals looking to understand attack vectors and defense mechanisms.

| 👤 **Man-in-the-Middle** | Intercept network communications |
| 🎣 **Phishing** | Social engineering simulations |
| 🦠 **Malware** | Malicious payload deployment |
| 🔐 **Ransomware** | Encryption-based attacks |

### 🛡️ Defense Mechanisms
| Defense Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| 🔥 **Web Firewall (WAF)** | Filter malicious requests |
| 🚫 **IP Blocking** | Blacklist suspicious sources |
| ⏱️ **Rate Limiting** | Throttle excessive requests |
| 🌐 **DNS Filtering** | Block malicious domains |
| 🔒 **Quarantine** | Isolate compromised systems |
| 💾 **Backup Restore** | Recover from attacks |

### 📚 Guided Lessons
- **Step-by-step tutorials** — Learn attack/defense workflows
- **Interactive quizzes** — Test your knowledge
- **Progress tracking** — Track your learning journey
- **AI Explanations** — Get context-aware guidance

### 🧪 Sandbox Mode
- **Free experimentation** — No restrictions, pure learning
